# Self-Evaluation

1. This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
-  I felt pretty good at the beginning of this exercise but started getting frustrated at the end once I kept hitting wall after all. My online research could have gone better but luckily I had the support of my small group and we were able to run things by each other. It felt good to finally finish the last challenge but I know that I have much practice ahead of me.

2. How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- My workflow is going well in large part due to this being the part time mod 0. I am staying focused.

3. What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
- I learned the importance of keep track of the "end" command to define and complete code blocks. I was also stuck on the use of "==" instead of "=" in several places for the very last exercise, but after much trial and error I eventually found the issue. I also learned that working with and having the support of your classmates can be the difference between success and failure.
